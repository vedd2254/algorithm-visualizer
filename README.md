# Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web-based algorithm visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project focuses on visually demonstrating how algorithms work step by step, starting with sorting algorithms. Users can observe comparisons, swaps, and execution flow in real time, making abstract algorithmic concepts easier to understand.

The project is designed as a learning tool to strengthen understanding of algorithms, data structures, and JavaScript logic through visualization rather than static code examples.

## Planned Features
- Bubble Sort visualization
- Step-by-step animation of comparisons and swaps
- Adjustable array size and animation speed
- Start / Reset controls
- Additional algorithms (future)
